  subHeading: I Build Beautiful User Experiences
  text:
    - > 
      I began my journey twelve years ago as a junior UI engineer for a small design company building 
      ColdFusion websites for construction companies. Today, I lead the UI efforts for one of America's largest insurance companies, working with technologies such as Angular 5, React and Node.js.
    - >
      Throughout my career, I've seen the Web grow from simple static HTML websites into complex 
      data-driven Progressive Web Apps. Over the years, I've invested countless hours honing 
      my skills to stay on top of the next emerging technology trend. I'm not an expert at everything 
      out there, but I'd be comfortable working in any tech stack, whether it be .NET, MEAN, React, or plain old vanilla JavaScript.

      Alan is a terrific Front-End developer with excellent knowledge in advanced scripting, 
      CSS, HTML5, and UI architecture. While working with Alan, his attention to detail was very 
      valuable as he worked on many high profile projects. When confronted with a problem, Alan 
      always persevered and would develop components to the website that utilized complex 
      functionality while maintaining flexibility and ease of implementation. I would recommend 
      Alan to any business looking for a solid front-end developer.

      Alan is a beast of a developer. Seriously. The guy is a cyborg or something. He is fearless 
      when it comes to technology. I don't think there is any problem you can throw at Alan that 
      he can't handle. All you have to say is "Hey Alan... do you think it's possible?" His response: 
      "Probably... just gimme a minute to figure it out". Fearless. I also trust him implicitly to 
      translate designs to code. What you design is what he builds. There have been times when I've 
      walked pass his desk and I've not been able to tell whether it was the mockup or the webpage 
      on his monitor. That's way more important and rare than it sounds, BTW. Collaborating with 
      Alan is a pleasure as well. He has great ideas and solutions to design problems. There are 
      times when you only have the bandwidth to partially flesh out an idea, and Alan can grasp 
      the concept with one discussion, then take it further if necessary. His input is always 
      beneficial. Alan is a huge asset to any team, and is definitely a vital part of ours.

      If you had five Alans you could rule the software universe. So I recommend hiring him and having 
      him train four other guys to be as good as he is. Alan is the kind of front-end developer UX 
      designers like myself dream of: Can work directly out of Photoshop comps, leveraging all 
      assets therein with zero confusion, follows wire-frames to the letter, focuses like a laser 
      on delivering high-quality front-end code that is virtually indistinguishable from the comp 
      he was handed and does all of this at lightning speed. It was typical for me to send him a 
      Photoshop comp on Tuesday and think he was merely reviewing it when I passed his cubicle on 
      Wednesday when in fact he had already turned the comp in to code -- using CSS to mirror much 
      of the imagery that appeared in the comp. The guy's a killer. If you're smart, you'll put him 
      in charge of your whole front-end team.
